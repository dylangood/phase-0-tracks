  <strong>My mom used to make me this strawberry bread for Christmas every year when I was a kid.</strong> It's delicious and moist, and with all the strawberries, it doesn't need as much sugar as some other dessert breads. When I grew up and moved to California, I started making it around the holidays, too.
  <p>
  It makes 6 mini loaves, <em>perfect</em> for a light dessert after a hearty family meal. They can be easily frozen and defrosted, and the cute little loaf tins can also be decorate simply with ribbons and celophane. They make excellent spontaneous gifts or party favors.
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <li>frozen whole or sliced strawberries</li>
    <li>vegetable oil</li>
    <li>flour</li>

    <li>salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Procedure</h2>

    <li>Sift together the flour, cinnamon, and salt.</li>

    <li>Set aside to cool for at least an hour before freezing.</li>
  </ol>
